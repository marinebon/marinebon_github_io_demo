## What is MBON?

`r img(src='img/about-mbon.jpg', style='float: right;')`

The Marine Biodiversity Observation Network is composed of regional networks of scientists, resource managers, and end-users working to integrate data from existing long-term programs to improve our understanding of changes and connections between marine biodiversity and ecosystem functions.   

 The MBON projects are integrating independent historical and current biological/ecological surveys and databases with biodiversity indices and add new observations that incorporate new remote sensing methods, novel molecular (eDNA) technologies, traditional environmental research tools, and coordinated experiments.

## Benefits of Creating an MBON  

MBON projects and their portals will play an important role in enabling the scientific community to describe the relationships between biodiversity, organism abundance, system productivity, and ecosystem services.

Anticipated Benefits of MBON include:

- Providing biological and environmental data collected by multiple independent programs in a single integrated web-based tool that informs scientists, resource managers, educators, and all relevant stakeholders about the state of marine biodiversity and how it is changing.

- Providing mechanisms to share data, experiences, knowledge, and protocols to understand species and the status and trends of ecosystem services.

- Contributing to increasing our understanding of physical and biological connectivity, including distributions and movements of species across biogeographical regions and political jurisdictions. 

- Sharing innovative technologies and methods developed for the observation of marine biodiversity (e.g. remote sensing and genetic methods).

- Expanding our knowledge of biodiversity and its connection to ecosystem services with the purpose of improving management of human activities that impact these services and promote sustainable use of such services.

- Amplify national investments in existing research and monitoring and data management.

- Optimizing the costs of data management and improve access to information on marine biodiversity and ecosystem health.

- Providing a framework for a region or a country to establish baselines to evaluate status and identify trends in future biodiversity and living marine resource assessments.
